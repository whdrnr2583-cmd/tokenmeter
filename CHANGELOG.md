# Changelog

All notable changes to Token Meter.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.1.17] — 2026-05-27

### Added
- **Cost forecast** (`usage_summary`): projects daily/weekly/monthly spend based on current-period
  pace so users can see "at this rate, this month will cost $X" before the bill arrives.
- **CSV / JSON export** (`token-meter export [--format csv|json] [--days N]`): dump the usage
  table to a file for use in spreadsheets, BI tools, or custom scripts.
- **Weekly digest** (`token-meter digest`): summarises the past 7 days — top models, top
  projects, cache efficiency, and waste signals — in a single terminal block. Designed for a
  Monday morning `npx @whdrnr2583/token-meter digest` habit.
- **Trim suggestions**: when the `session_tools` MCP tool (or CLI equivalent) detects
  outlier-large tool responses (>95th-percentile chars), it now appends a concrete
  "trim this tool" recommendation with the estimated token savings.

### Why
Pro-tier value consolidation. CSV/JSON export and forecast were the two most-requested
items from dogfood sessions; weekly digest and trim suggestions close the
"I know I'm spending but I don't know what to do about it" loop.

## [0.1.16] — 2026-05-20

### Added
- **Daily table with one row per (day, model)** in `usage_summary`. Primary
  view is a fixed-column table (Day · Model · Input · Output · Cache_rd ·
  USD) where each model used on a given day gets its own row — so 5/15
  opus-4-7 / haiku-4-5 / sonnet-4-6 split into three lines with their own
  token counts and cost, instead of collapsing into one combined row. ccusage
  inspired but stricter: a 99% Opus / 1% Haiku day no longer looks the same
  as a 50/50 day. The narrative "Where / Slowest / Heaviest" stays underneath
  as an advisory spotlight, no longer the top-of-output anchor.
- **`scope` parameter** on `usage_summary` — auto-detects current platform
  (`process.platform: linux → WSL/Linux`, `win32 → Windows`) and filters
  rows accordingly so a Claude Code session on WSL doesn't get mixed with
  Codex / Windows-Claude data. Values: `auto` (default) · `all` · `wsl` ·
  `linux` · `win` · `windows` · `codex` · `claude-code`. Overridable via
  `TOKEN_METER_SCOPE` env var. Banner shows the active scope; a hint surfaces
  how much spend is hidden ("$X.YY hidden — pass scope=\"all\" to include").
- New `dailyByModel()` query in stats.ts and a `ScopeFilter` type usable by
  callers (CLI, dashboard) that need the same source separation.
- Regression test `test/ingest-subagent.test.ts` and standalone verifier
  `scripts/verify-subagent-scan.mjs` for the sub-agent JSONL scan path.

### Discovery & trust footer (all tools)
- **3-line discovery footer** appended to every tool reply, all
  hard-coded plain text so the cost of telling users about sibling tools
  and project URLs is **zero inference tokens**:
  1. Trust: `ⓘ 100% local · 0 LLM calls — this output is hard-coded`
  2. Sibling pointer: tool-specific `🔧 Next: …` cross-promotion
  3. Links: `🔗 token-meter.dev · github.com/whdrnr2583-cmd/token-meter · Pro $5/mo (...)`
- **Server `instructions` field rewritten** with a structured list of all
  4 MCP tools + 3 CLI commands (`stats`, `serve`, `install-mcp`) + the
  project URLs. Surfaced at the MCP connect handshake so even a user who
  never calls a tool still sees the full surface.
- **Empty-state path** ("no usage data yet") now ends with the same
  discovery footer instead of trailing off, so the first-run user knows
  where to go next.

### Visual design polish
- **Day-group divider** — light `· · · ·` dots between days so multi-model
  rows from the same day group visually (kept lighter than the heavy `─`
  table boundary, per Tufte data-ink ratio).
- **`Calls` column** — per-(day, model) API call count. Knowing Haiku ran
  177 calls vs 4 calls is meaningful even when the dollar share is small.
- **`%day` column** — model's share of that day's spend. `<1%` is shown
  for non-zero but rounds-to-zero shares so "tiny but present" stays
  distinguishable from "literally zero".
- **Total row uses `═` heavy separator** with a blank line above so it
  reads as a footer, not just another data row. No ANSI color (MCP
  clients vary in support).
- **`scope` hidden hint moved to its own line** under the title. When the
  breakdown gets long (multi-source), folding it keeps the header
  scannable instead of running across.
- **Footer collapsed to a single line** — trust signal + Pro CTA combined
  to keep MCP-tool responses lean.

### Changed (readability fixes from review)
- **Slowest excludes user-blocking tools.** `AskUserQuestion` (and any
  human-input tool) used to dominate the "Slowest" line at e.g. 178s avg —
  pure reaction-time, not tool latency. They are now excluded from
  `Slowest`; a separate `User wait` line surfaces them so the info isn't
  lost, with a "time spent waiting on you, not the tool" disambiguator.
- **`scope` hidden hint breaks out by source.** Instead of a single
  "$86.36 hidden by scope" amount, the banner now shows
  `hidden: Windows $84.93 · Codex $1.43` so the reader knows *what* was
  excluded, not just *how much*. Complementary platform and Codex slices
  are queried once per call.
- **`Cache_R` column renamed to `Cache_rd`** to disambiguate from
  "% cache reuse" in the Summary line — same prefix, different concept.
- **`session_tools` adds a per-tool % share.** Each row now shows
  `(N.N%)` next to `resp=` — "Bash 49.7% · Read 47.5%" makes the
  dominant tool obvious instead of asking the reader to mentally divide.

### Fixed
- **Sub-agent JSONL files were silently dropped from ingest** — Claude Code
  writes each Task / Agent invocation to
  `<project>/<sessionId>/subagents/agent-<id>.jsonl` (two levels deep).
  v0.1.15 ingest only read `.jsonl` at the project root, so every Haiku /
  Sonnet / overridden-model row dispatched through a sub-agent was missed.
  Re-ingesting on a representative machine recovered ~3,900 Haiku + ~1,600
  Sonnet events that were invisible to the per-model breakdown. Plus
  historical `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5`, `claude-sonnet-4-5`
  models that had no recorded events at all are now surfaced.

### Why
Tester feedback (3 paid Claude users, 2026-05-19) was consistent: "the
single $-line is interesting, but I don't know what to look at." The
ccusage convention (per-day rows · models surfaced as labels · totals at
the bottom) gives the answer at a glance instead of asking the reader to
parse one dense narrative line. Source isolation removes the "why do I
see Codex when I'm in Claude Code" confusion. The sub-agent fix landed
in the same patch because the model breakdown is the new headline view
— it would have been misleading without the missing Haiku / Sonnet data.

### Notes
- `src/*.ts` for files **other than** mcp.ts / stats.ts / ingest.ts /
  db.ts / pricing.ts remain at v0.1.8 line counts. v0.1.9 → v0.1.15 work
  was published from an external build location and the corresponding
  source was never committed here. v0.1.16 reconstructs only the files
  needed for this release; the other dist files are preserved verbatim
  from the v0.1.15 npm artifact. Tracked as TODO for v0.1.17+.

## [0.1.8] — 2026-05-15

### Changed
- **GitHub repository renamed** `whdrnr2583-cmd/tokenmeter` →
  `whdrnr2583-cmd/token-meter` for naming consistency with the npm
  package (`@whdrnr2583/token-meter`) and the domain
  (`token-meter.dev`). GitHub auto-redirects the old URL, so existing
  links keep working; all in-repo references and the embedded raw URLs
  used by the "ask your LLM to set it up" path have been updated to the
  new URL.
- README now includes a one-line lookup row near the top:
  npm · GitHub · site links in canonical form, so anyone copy-pasting
  from the npm page can find the repo without guessing.

### Why
A reader reported the GitHub URL guessed from the npm scope
(`whdrnr2583/token-meter`) returns 404 — the actual owner is
`whdrnr2583-cmd` and the repo was `tokenmeter` (no hyphen). Trust
hit at the discovery step. Fix is a one-time rename plus an explicit
lookup row; no behavior change. D-035.

---

## [0.1.7] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **`/token-meter` slash command for Claude Code**. Run
  `npx -y @whdrnr2583/token-meter install-command claude-code` to install
  a short markdown file at `~/.claude/commands/token-meter.md`; after a
  Claude Code restart, typing `/token-meter` triggers a single summary
  view that calls the `usage_summary` MCP tool and appends a one-block
  hint about the other slash commands, the CLI, and the Pro tier.

  This is in addition to the existing MCP prompts. MCP clients always
  prefix prompts as `/mcp__token-meter__<name>` (spec-mandated); the new
  custom slash command is the way to get a short `/token-meter` entry
  point. Currently `install-command claude-code` is the only supported
  client — Cursor / Claude Desktop use different slash-command systems
  and are out of scope for this release.

  Idempotent (re-run is `already-present`). Backs up an existing managed
  file to `<path>.bak` before overwriting. Refuses to overwrite an
  unmanaged file (no `@whdrnr2583/token-meter` marker) and exits 1.

### Changed
- **`usage_summary` MCP tool now includes an MCP / tools breakdown**
  (top 5 by response tokens) so the new `/token-meter` slash command can
  show "today + MCP / tools" in a single call. Existing callers see one
  extra section appended to the same text response; the tool signature
  is unchanged.

### Why
Follow-up to v0.1.6 dogfood UX work (D-033). MCP-prefixed slash commands
work but are visually long; the new custom slash command is the short
`/token-meter` entry point that surfaces today's usage plus a small,
honest hint about the Pro tier. Still a dogfood UX bet (D-034), not a
direct payment trigger.

---

## [0.1.6] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **MCP prompts (slash commands)** — the four read-only tools are now also
  exposed as prompts, so clients that surface MCP prompts (Claude Code,
  Cursor, Claude Desktop) show them as slash commands:
  - `/mcp__token-meter__usage_summary` (arg: `period` = `today` | `week` |
    `month`, default `today`)
  - `/mcp__token-meter__recent_sessions` (arg: `within_hours` = 1-720,
    default 24)
  - `/mcp__token-meter__session_tools` (arg: `session_id`, required)
  - `/mcp__token-meter__refresh_data` (no args)

  Each prompt returns a one-line user-role message that asks the agent to
  call the matching tool. Natural-language invocation ("show me my usage
  this week") still works exactly as before — the prompts are an additive
  shortcut for users who prefer typing `/`.

### Why
Dogfood UX shortcut, not a feature-value bet. The four tools were already
reachable by asking the agent in natural language; adding prompts is a ~50
LOC additive change that lets the author and other slash-command-leaning
users skip the typing. Marketing weight and pricing position are
unchanged.

---

## [0.1.5] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **`token-meter install-mcp <client>`** — one-command MCP registration.
  Supported clients: `claude-code`, `cursor`, `claude-desktop`, `all`.
  Add `--dry-run` to preview without writing.
  - **Claude Code**: shells out to `claude mcp add ...` (auto-detected,
    skipped with a clear message if the `claude` CLI isn't on PATH).
  - **Cursor / Claude Desktop**: read/merge the platform-specific JSON
    config (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`, macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/`,
    Windows `%APPDATA%\Claude\`, Linux `~/.config/Claude/`). Preserves
    any existing `mcpServers` entries; writes a `<path>.bak` backup
    before overwriting an existing file.
  - Idempotent — re-running prints `already-present` instead of writing.
  - `install-mcp.ts` and 7 unit tests covering create / idempotent /
    preserve-others / update-stale / dry-run / invalid-JSON / empty-file.

### Changed
- **MCP setup docs rewritten for self-service**. `docs/mcp-server.md`
  now leads with the one-command installer and falls back to per-client
  copy-paste blocks (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, ChatGPT,
  generic stdio) with verification and a troubleshooting section.
- **README "Connect to your AI tool"** points at `install-mcp all` first;
  also keeps the LLM-driven "ask the agent to set it up" prompt and the
  per-client manual table for users who prefer to do it themselves.
- **Landing page** (`token-meter.dev`) `#connect` section: one-command box
  on top, LLM-prompt box second, manual cards below.
- `token-meter setup <key>` now points users at `install-mcp` for the
  MCP-registration step (instead of printing raw commands inline).

### Why
First-time users on Cursor / Claude Desktop / ChatGPT had no concrete
path before — `install-mcp` collapses the four-step manual flow
(locate config → open with the right path per OS → merge JSON →
restart the app) into one command, and gives LLM-driven setup
something deterministic to call.

---

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **`token-meter setup <key>`** — one-shot subcommand bundling
  `activate <key>` + appending `export TOKEN_METER_GATING=1` to the user's
  shell rc (`~/.zshrc` → `~/.bashrc` → `~/.profile`, first existing) +
  printing the MCP-registration commands for Claude Code / Cursor.
  Idempotent: detects existing `TOKEN_METER_GATING` line in the rc and
  skips appending. Windows skips the rc append and tells the user to
  run `setx TOKEN_METER_GATING 1` instead.
- `appendShellRc()` helper in `src/license.ts` (exported, reusable).

### Why
Setup used to be 4 manual commands (install, activate, edit shell rc,
register MCP). `setup` collapses the first three into one, and the
license email template (v0.1.3 worker change) now points at this
command for the LLM-assisted install path.

---

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- **License-tier gating scaffold** (`src/license.ts`). Three tiers: `free`,
  `pro`, `pro_plus`. Resolves entitlement from `TOKEN_METER_LICENSE` env or
  `~/.tokenmeter/license.json`. **Disabled by default during the beta** —
  set `TOKEN_METER_GATING=1` to test gating locally.
- Free vs Pro caps:
  - **History**: 7 days (Free) / 30 days (Pro) / unbounded (Pro+).
  - **Smart alert rules**: 1 (Free) / unlimited (Pro+).
  - **Alert action types**: `notify.desktop` (Free) / desktop + webhook +
    email (Pro+).
  - **Session drill-down API** (`/api/sessions*`): Pro+ only (HTTP 402 to
    Free callers).
- CLI emits a one-line warning when `stats <days>` is clamped by the
  active tier.
- **`token-meter activate <key>`** CLI command. Verifies the key against
  the worker API and writes `~/.tokenmeter/license.json` with permission
  `0600`.
- **Remote license verify** in `src/license.ts` (`verifyLicenseRemote`,
  `activateLicense`). Default API base `https://api.token-meter.dev`,
  override via `TOKEN_METER_API_BASE`.
- **7-day offline grace period**: after a successful `activate`, the
  local config keeps the Pro/Pro+ tier active for 7 days without
  re-verification. After that, the tier falls back to Free until the
  user runs `activate` again.
- **`infra/api` worker hardening**:
  - Polar webhook signature verify (HMAC-SHA256, ±5 min replay window
    via `webhook-id` / `webhook-timestamp` / `webhook-signature`
    headers). **Polar diverges from the Standard Webhooks reference**
    in two places (D-032): HMAC key is the **full secret as raw UTF-8
    bytes** (no base64 decode, `polar_whs_` prefix included); event id
    comes from the `webhook-id` HTTP header (not the body). Verified
    e2e on 2026-05-15.
  - License-issuance email shipped through **Resend** (`RESEND_API_KEY`
    + `RESEND_FROM` env). Email contains the key, the `activate`
    command, and the env-var fallback.
- **`docs/billing-setup.md`** — step-by-step runbook for the
  Polar / Cloudflare D1 / Resend / custom-domain wiring, including the
  end-to-end live-test checklist.

### Notes
- Gating is dormant in this release. With `TOKEN_METER_GATING` unset (the
  default), every caller resolves to Pro+ and existing behaviour is
  preserved. The flag flips to default-on once Polar checkout +
  webhook-driven license issuance lands (D-031 γ).

---

## [0.1.2] — 2026-05-14

### Fixed
- **`token-meter serve` subcommand was missing from the CLI**, even though the
  README and v0.1.0 changelog promised a dashboard at `http://localhost:8765`.
  The dashboard module existed (`src/server.ts`) but was only reachable via
  `npm run serve` from a checkout — npx / global-install users hit
  `Usage: ...` and exit 1. Now `token-meter serve` works end-to-end.

### Added
- `token-meter --version` / `-v` prints the installed version.
- `token-meter --help` / `-h` / `help` prints usage and exits 0
  (previously any unknown argument was treated as an error).

## [0.1.1] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- `mcpName: io.github.whdrnr2583-cmd/token-meter` in `package.json` so the
  package can be registered on the official MCP Registry
  (https://registry.modelcontextprotocol.io). No runtime behavior change.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-13

First public release.

### Added

**Core**
- Local-first CLI + dashboard for Claude Code and Codex token usage.
- JSONL parsers for `~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl` (Claude Code) and
  `~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl` (Codex).
- SQLite storage at `~/.tokenpulse/usage.db` (legacy folder name carried
  through v0.1; renamed to `~/.tokenmeter/` with auto-migration in a future
  release) with WAL mode and incremental ingest (mtime + size).
- Dashboard at `http://localhost:8765` with day / model / project / source
  breakdowns, hourly distribution, and Chart.js visualizations.

**MCP server (`token-meter mcp`)**
- `usage_summary` — spend + token summary per period (today / week / month).
- `recent_sessions` — sessions with activity in the last N hours, with
  ready-to-paste `claude --resume` / `codex resume` commands. Useful when a
  terminal was closed by accident.
- `session_tools` — per-session breakdown of MCP / built-in tool calls,
  response sizes, and average latency.
- `refresh_data` — re-scan source JSONL files on demand.

**MCP / tool breakdown**
- Per-MCP-server and per-tool grouping (`mcp__<server>__<tool>` pattern).
- Latency, response size (chars + estimated tokens), and call count.

**Session drill-down**
- Top sessions by USD cost in the selected window.
- Per-message breakdown (input / output / cache read / cache write / USD).
- Per-session tool breakdown.

**Smart alerts (rules engine)**
- Threshold rules on daily / weekly / monthly USD, daily output tokens, or
  daily cache write tokens.
- Built-in actions: desktop notification, webhook POST, email (Pro, wired in
  M3), weekly digest (planned).
- Per-rule cooldown (24h default) and dry-run preview against historical data.
- Pending desktop notifications surfaced via the dashboard's browser
  `Notification` API.

**Pricing & cost estimates**
- USD-equivalent calculation for Anthropic (Opus 4.x / Sonnet 4.x / Haiku 4.x)
  and OpenAI (GPT-5 / GPT-5-Codex / GPT-5-mini / GPT-4o / GPT-4o-mini).
- Treated as **estimates**; not validated against vendor invoices. Disclaimer
  surfaced on the dashboard and README.

**Quality / safety**
- 14 unit tests (parser dedup, pricing reproducibility, XSS escape regression).
- 8-section data invariant audit script (`npm run audit`): USD conservation
  across views, dedup uniqueness, pricing reproducibility, temporal sanity,
  tool integrity, source-specific checks, rules engine, ingest state.
- CI matrix: typecheck (Ubuntu) + test (Ubuntu / macOS / Windows) + build +
  MCP smoke against built `dist/`.
- HTML escape (`esc()`) applied to all user-controlled string interpolations
  in the dashboard.

### Fixed
- **Critical**: deduplicate per-`request_id` token events. Claude Code splits
  a single API response into multiple JSONL entries (e.g. one `thinking`
  block + one `text` block) that all carry the same final `usage`. Before the
  fix, this triple-counted. Cost figures on the user's local data dropped
  ~60% to match the actual per-call billing.

### Security
- Dashboard server binds to `127.0.0.1` only.
- All SQL queries use parameter binding.
- Webhook actions: 5-second timeout per fire; no retry. **Webhook URL is
  user-supplied — see `docs/customization.md` for the SSRF caveat.**

### Notes
- Pro / Pro+ feature gating is currently inactive; all features are open
  during the free beta. License-gated tiers activate with the M3 paid launch.
- Pro+ (local LLM proxy, GPU tracking, behavior-changing automations) is on
  the M4+ conditional roadmap, not in this release.
